Alright, someone said "$word," I'm outta here.
$word? $WORD?! Are you kidding me right now, $peer?
You can't just go around saying "$word" willy-nilly on the streets!
Someone said "$word"... guess I'll show myself out.
What were we thinking? We're just a couple of bugs in this world.
You know, someone said "$word," and I'm really feeling some hostility right now, so I'm just gonna go.
What's the deal with $word, anyway?
"$word?" Okay, okay, I'll stop.
"$word?" That is diabolical.
"$word?" Wow. Way to rain on the parade, $peer.
Wow. The tension out here is just unbelievable. I think I'm gonna go.
"$word?" Jeez, you didn't have to be such a crooked honeycomb about it.
"$word?" Gosh, no need to get a bent stinger about it.
Did you really just say "$word?" You know, I've sued entire races for less.
You know, I'm getting really mixed signals from you lately. It was all "honey" yesterday, but "$word" today... are you sure you're not bee-polar?
"$word?" Oh, that's rich coming from a guy called $peer.
